	With Flow:
	
		1.) Label sections right-to-left.	
		2.) Multiple duct matrices from right-to-left (start with identity matrix).
		3.) Calculate termination impedence AT RIGHTMOST ELEMENT?
	
		



QUESTION 1

	NO QUESTIONS.	No class questions.

	
QUESTION 2

	Are my plots correct?  Yes.  Check scaling.
	
	
QUESTION 3

	Does the hole size\diameter offset the lengths of the adjoining duct sections?  (29/1/2025)
	
		No.  Point impedance.
	
	Treat the non-hole condition as a quarter-wavelength or a half-wavelength duct?  (29/1/2025)
	

QUESTION 4

	IS THE DIP BETWEEN 100 Hz and 200 Hz?  134 Hz
	
	
	Lossy Helmholtz resonator?  Target frequency of 134 Hz?

	What is the correct equation for Mach number?  (30/1/2025)
	
		V / (S * c)


QUESTION 5

	IS THE DIP BETWEEN 500 Hz AND 1 kHz?
	

	The combined system includes the lossy Helmholtz resonator?  Yes.
		This will change the dip\notch attenuation level.
	
	THE AREA EXPANSION RATIO IS DETERMINED USING THE ORIGINAL DUCT DIAMETERS,
	The lined duct and the orifice left after lining?
